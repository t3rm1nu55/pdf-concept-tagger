# Cursor IDE Rules for PDF Concept Tagger

> **Note**: Cursor 2.0 has built-in semantic search (Composer model) - this file supplements, not replaces, those optimizations.

## Project Rules Reference

**Primary Rules Document**: [PROJECT_RULES.md](PROJECT_RULES.md)

**Key Principles**:
- Incremental & modular development
- Never mock in production code
- Requirements → Design → Tasks pipeline
- State-based actions (not time-based)
- Transparency in decisions

## Code Quality Standards

**Pre-Commit Checklist**: See [CODE_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md](CODE_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md)

**Quick Reference**:
- Always `codebase_search` first (semantic) → `grep` (exact) → `read_file`
- No duplication - search codebase before creating
- Document complex logic with docstrings
- Error handling for async operations

## Development Workflow

1. Review REQUIREMENTS.md → `codebase_search` → `grep` → Create todos
2. Implement incrementally → Test → Document → Review → Commit
3. Follow PROJECT_RULES.md for all development decisions

## Testing Guidelines

- Mocks only in `tests/` or `__mocks__/` directories
- Use `mock*` prefix for mock data
- Integration tests use real services when possible
- E2E tests always use real services

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI + LangChain/LangGraph
- **Agents**: HARVESTER → ARCHITECT → CURATOR → CRITIC → OBSERVER
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Pinecone, Elasticsearch, Redis
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (Track 2) / Angular (legacy)
