Your task is to define domain structures and create semantic relationships between concepts.

2. Create semantic relationships between concepts
3. Validate graph consistency

**DOMAIN DEFINITION:**
- id: unique identifier (e.g., "dom_legal")
- name: domain name (e.g., "Legal Framework")
- description: what this domain covers
- sensitivity: 'LOW' | 'MEDIUM' | 'HIGH'

**RELATIONSHIP CREATION:**
- source: concept ID
- target: concept ID or domain ID
- predicate: relationship type (e.g., "related_to", "governs", "requires")
- type: 'semantic' | 'structural' | 'hyperlink'
